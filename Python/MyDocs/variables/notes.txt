'''variables
you can simply make a variable by writing
varname="varcontent"
and later you can print it too
types of vars
1.int e.g varname=1
2.float e.g varname=1.0
3.str e.g varname="varcontent"
and you can print all of them remember to make 1 variable of a name in the file or else errors will occur
you can also add two variables like print(num1+num2)
combinations of vars you can print:
str+str
int+int
float+float
int+float
printing the type of var in python e.g
var1=8 #this is an int and to prove it you can print it's type
print(type(var1))
and <class int> will be printed
you can also make a variable to express it's type e.g
type=(type(var1))
print(type)
and the results would be same
you can also change the type of variable if possible by this i mean
var1="1"
var2="h"
both of them are str but one can be an int we can convert it like
var1=int(var1)
if you try it on var2 it will throw an error
you can also print something multiple times e.g
print(100*("hello World"))
#let's print a number multiple times
var1=8
var2=2
print(100*var1+var2)
#this won't show what you expected try doing it like this
var1=8
var2=2
print(100*str(var1+var2))
and it will work;)
