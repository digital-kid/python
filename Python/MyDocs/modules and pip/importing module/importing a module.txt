to import a module simply type "import (module name)"
e.g to import random i will type "import random" it's 
it on the top of the document because it can probably
give you some errors e.g the test.py in this folder
is also a python file and i used the tkinter module
in it i wrote the code like this:
		root=Tk()
		from tkinter import*
		root.manloop()
as you can see i wrote root=Tk() which is a code
you write in tkinter and after that i imported the
tkinter module and when i run it it shows root=Tk()
is not defined and if i import the module at the
beginning it will work properly
