you can also use python as a calculator just open cmd
type python and then add your operations e.g 5+5 and 
then press enter it will give you 10 it's important
to do it in the interpreter because
if you will do it as a file it will return nothing
*i created test.py and did operations in it
(test.py is in the folder)
